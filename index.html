      <p>My first ever computing class in High School. I was hooked and received an A.
        I approched this class with the empty cup concept. Information is the water with which we fill the cup. 
        I made sure that everyday my cup was empty so that I could learn as much as possible.
        Keeping a growth mindset is key. </p>
