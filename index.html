      <p>I am a Freshmen at Chico State currently enrolled in CSCI111: problem solving and 
        software design using procedural object-oriented programming languages. 
        Coverage includes the software life cycle, as well as algorithms and their role in software design. 
        I design, implement, and test a number of programs. </p>

      <p>My first ever computing class in High School. I was hooked and received an A.
        I approched this class with the empty cup concept. Information is the water with which we fill the cup. 
        I made sure that everyday my cup was empty so that I could learn as much as possible.
        Keeping a growth mindset is key. </p>

      <p>I set my objectives to updating my linkedin, connecting with my professor and understanding the course. 
I will be problem solving in C++. I will be working with my Terminal connecting to our schools server and turning in work to a website Chico's Computer Science deperatment devloped called "turnin". Today I created a turnin account and refreshed myself with vim navagation.

      <p>Today I learned how to transfer files from my schools server: "Jaguar" to my local Macintosh. My objective here is to turn in the code to the turnin platform. My coding is server based which is benefitcal because it allows me to work on my projects in my dorm and I can pick back up in the lab.</p>
